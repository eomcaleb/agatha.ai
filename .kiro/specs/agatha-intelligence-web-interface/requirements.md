# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Agatha is an intelligence web interface tool that allows users to discover and explore relevant websites through AI-powered search and ranking. Users input prompts describing what they want to research, and the system finds, ranks, and displays relevant websites in an immersive horizontal card interface inspired by Minority Report. The tool runs entirely client-side with bring-your-own-key API access to various LLM providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Web Search and Discovery

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to input a search prompt and have the system find relevant websites, so that I can discover information sources I might not have found through traditional search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search prompt THEN the system SHALL query multiple web sources to find potentially relevant websites
2. WHEN websites are discovered THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze and rank them by relevance to the user's prompt
3. WHEN ranking is complete THEN the system SHALL display results ordered from most relevant to least relevant
4. IF no relevant sites are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest refining their prompt

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Content Analysis and Ranking

**User Story:** As a user, I want each website to be analyzed for relevance and have a confidence score, so that I can quickly identify the most valuable sources for my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a website is processed THEN the system SHALL generate a brief description of its contents relevant to the user's prompt
2. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL assign a confidence score indicating relevance certainty
3. WHEN multiple sites are analyzed THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance score
4. IF content cannot be analyzed THEN the system SHALL indicate this with an appropriate confidence score

### Requirement 3: Immersive Horizontal Card Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse discovered websites in a Minority Report-style horizontal card interface, so that I can efficiently explore multiple sources in an engaging visual format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them as horizontal scrollable cards
2. WHEN a user scrolls through cards THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth navigation between results
3. WHEN a card is selected THEN the system SHALL display the website content in an embedded iframe
4. WHEN displaying iframes THEN the system SHALL attempt to remove or minimize pop-ups and overlays

### Requirement 4: Client-Side Architecture with Multi-Provider LLM Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use my own API keys with various LLM providers, so that I can control my costs and choose my preferred AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to input API keys for supported providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, xAI)
2. WHEN making AI requests THEN the system SHALL use the user's configured API keys
3. WHEN processing occurs THEN all computation SHALL happen client-side without sending data to external servers
4. IF API keys are not configured THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to add them before proceeding

### Requirement 5: Pop-up and Overlay Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want websites to display cleanly without intrusive pop-ups, so that I can focus on the actual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a website in an iframe THEN the system SHALL attempt to detect and remove common pop-up elements
2. WHEN overlays are detected THEN the system SHALL try to dismiss or hide them automatically
3. IF pop-ups cannot be removed THEN the system SHALL indicate this to the user
4. WHEN content is cleaned THEN the system SHALL preserve the main content and navigation

### Requirement 6: TypeScript-First React Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to use TypeScript primarily, so that the application is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript over JavaScript wherever possible
2. WHEN defining interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive type definitions
3. WHEN building the React application THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript best practices
4. IF JavaScript is used THEN it SHALL be limited to cases where TypeScript is not practical

### Requirement 7: Extensible Model and Provider Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different AI models and providers, so that I can optimize for my specific needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring AI settings THEN the user SHALL be able to select from available models within each provider
2. WHEN providers are added THEN the system SHALL support their specific API formats and capabilities
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL use the user's selected model and provider combination
4. IF a provider or model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and suggest alternatives
